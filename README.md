# 4x5 film holder for the Epson v600 scanner

Allows for scanning of large format film sheets in two passes: one with the holder pushed to the lower left corner, and another with the holder slid all the way to the right. The resulting scans can be merged automatically in Lightroom or Photoshop.

For scanning, I use VueScan with raw DNG output and the "lock exposure" checkmark to ensure that the two scans match.
